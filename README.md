# Safety_Incident_Dashboard-PowerBI
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing safety incident data,using power query for transformation and DAX for measures.
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the analysis and visualization of workplace safety incidents using Power BI, with data sourced from Excel. The dashboard helps organizations track incidents by department, shift, and severity, enabling better decision-making to improve safety performance.
Objective
Monitor and analyze safety incidents across different departments and shifts.
Identify trends and high-risk areas to reduce workplace hazards.
Provide interactive visual insights through KPIs and charts.
Data Source
File: Excel spreadsheet containing safety incident records
Columns include: Incident ID, Department, Shift, Severity, Incident Type, Report Date, Resolution Date, Injured Count, etc.
Data Preparation:
Imported into Power BI using Power Query
Cleaned and transformed data: removed duplicates, fixed data types, handled missing values, created calculated columns and measures for KPI analysis.
Tools & Techniques
Excel: Raw data preparation
Power BI Desktop: Data transformation, modeling, and visualization
Power Query: Data cleaning and shaping
DAX Measures: Total Injuries, Severity Breakdown, Trend Analysis
Visuals Used: KPI cards, column charts, donut charts, slicers for department, shift, and severity
Key Insights
Night shifts in certain departments report higher incident rates.
Severity distribution highlights areas needing urgent safety interventions.
Enables management to prioritize safety measures effectively.
